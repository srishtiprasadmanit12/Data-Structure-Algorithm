## Backtracking




## observation:1 
If question says find all possible subset, substring --> these type of question fall under backtracking
constrain is very small as when we use recursion(backtracking) 2^n would pass test case.

Total n length and har index pe you have two options to explore , this is 2^n time complexity

## template of backtracking

1.DO
2.Explore
3.undo
