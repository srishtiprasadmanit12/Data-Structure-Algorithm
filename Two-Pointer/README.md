# TWO POINTER APPROCH

#### WE CAN CATEGORISE TWO POINTER APPROCH 

1. **Running from both ends of an array**

    This approach is typically used when you need to compare or process elements from both ends of the array towards the center.

    For Examples:

    **Palindrome Checking**: To determine if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.
    **Two-Sum Problem (Sorted Array)**: To find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target.
    **Container With Most Water**: To find the maximum area of water that can be contained by two vertical lines.
<br>

2. **Slow & Fast Pointers**

    This approach is mainly used in linked lists for detecting cycles, finding the middle of the list, and other related problems.

    For Examples:

    **Cycle Detection (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare)**: To detect if a linked list has a cycle.
    **Finding the Middle of a Linked List**: To find the middle element of a linked list.
<br>
3. **Running from beginning of 2 arrays / Merging 2 arrays**

    This approach is used for merging two sorted arrays or iterating through two arrays simultaneously.

    For Examples:

    **Merge Sorted Arrays**: To merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
    **Intersection of Two Arrays**: To find the common elements between two sorted arrays.
<br>
4. **Split & Merge of an array / Divide & Conquer**

    This approach is used in divide-and-conquer algorithms where an array or list is divided into smaller parts, processed, and then merged back together.

)
    For Examples:

    **Merge Sort**: To sort an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and merging the sorted halves.
    **Quick Sort**: To sort an array by selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the partitions.
