# Sliding window Technique
The sliding window technique is a powerful approach for solving problems that involve working with a subset of contiguous element in a data structure like an array of a string.This technique helps in reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many scenarios by avoiding redundant computation.

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a window(subset) of elements that **slides** over the data structure from one end to other to capture different subset. The size of window can be fixed or variable depending on different problem requirement.

Types of Sliding window
1. Fixed size sliding window : window size is constant throughout the process
2. Variable size sliding window : window size can change based on certain consditions or constraints
